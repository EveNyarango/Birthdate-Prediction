    <h1>Akan Names</h1>
    <img src="./images/kids2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>The tradition goes back to the Akan tribe: to name their children by the day of their birth. Different Ghanaian
        ethnic groups largely share one common belief: the naming of their children. They name children according to their gender and the day of the week they were born.</p>
